## Overview
This chapter introduces how this resource is organized, explains how you can add to this resource, and includes some general acknowledgments.  

## Types of Assistance

Chapters in this resources are color-coded to indicate the type of assistance the chapter provides. Below is an explanation of each type:

### Information (Blue)

![](images/banners/banner_blue.png)

Blue pages contain basic **information**. Examples of blue pages include this introduction page and the [basics page](basics.html), which explains how to setup R/RStudio as well as ways to get help if you need it. Blue pages are the help desk of this resource: look to them if you are lost and need to find your way.

### Walkthroughs (Red)

![](images/banners/banner_red.png)

Red pages contain more extensive **walkthroughs**. An example of a red page is the [iris walkthrough](iris.html), where a well-known dataset is presented as a pretty scatterplot and steps are shown from start to finish. This page type is the most thorough: it tries to provide full documentation, explanations of design choices, and advice on best practices. It's like going to office hours and having a great clarifying chat with a course assistant...in article form. If you would like to see a fully-worked-through example of something with a lot of guidance along the way, check out the red pages.

### Documentation (Green)

Green pages contain more compact **documentation**. An example of a green page is the [histogram page](histo.html), which includes simple examples of how to create histograms, when to use them, and things to be aware of/watch out for. The green pages hold your hand much less than the red pages: they explain how to use a chart/tool using examples and simple terms. If you have an idea in mind and are just wondering how to execute it, the green pages will help fill in those gaps.

### References (Yellow)

![](images/banners/banner_yellow.png)

Yellow pages contain simple collections of  **references**. An example of a yellow page is the [external resources page](general.html), which is a list of materials that you can look through and learn from. Yellow pages have the least amount of hand-holding: they are collections of resources and bare-boned tutorials that will help you learn about new things.
