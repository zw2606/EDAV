## Overview

This section describes workflows for working with GitHub/Git and advice on how to collaborate in teams on large coding projects. If you're interested in learning how to propose changes to [edav.info](edav.info) (or any other repo) without leaving github.com, see our [Contributing to this Resource](contribute.html) chapter.

Ok, not satisfied with fixing typos on GitHub? Ready to work locally and move code back and forth between your repositories (or someone else's) and your machine? For that you'll need Git, a widely used version control system. It is super useful and powerful, but people also find it quite annoying and [difficult to understand](https://xkcd.com/1597/){target="_blank"}. Rather than trying to master the whole system, we suggest beginning with some basic workflows, as outlined below.  You can derive great benefits from it without being an expert (trust me, I know!)
 
## First things first

1. *Install Git* To do so, follow the instructions in the [Install Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html){target="_blank"} chapter of *Happy Git with R*.

2. *Tell Git your name and email address.* [Introduce yourself to Git](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html){target="_blank"} in *Happy Git* explains it all.

3. (Optional) *Make sure that you can pull from and push to GitHub from your computer* [Connect to GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html){target="_blank"} 

## The no branch workflow

To get comfortable with Git, start with this basic workflow in which you will be pulling from and pushing to *your* repo on GitHub. Just you, no collaboration:

![](images/git/no-branch.png)

The [Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html){target="_blank"} chapter of *Happy Git* will get you set up: you will create a repo on GitHub, clone the repo into an RStudio project, and practice making changes.

Once you're set up, your local workflow will be **pull, work, commit/push**. 

**PULL** Each time you open RStudio and switch to the project, you will pull down any changes made to the repo on GitHub by clicking the **Down Arrow** in the Git pane of RStudio. You may think that no changes have been made to GitHub and there's nothing to pull, but you may forget the typos that you fixed online, so it's good practice to always start by pulling changes just in case.

**WORK** Do your stuff. Make changes to files. Add new files.  Keep an eye on the Git panel in RStudio; it will show you which files were changes.

**COMMIT/PUSH** When you're done working, you'll want to think about what to do with the files that have changed. I like to keep the Git panel clear, so when I'm done I do one of three things with each file: 1) click "Staged" to get it ready for a sendoff to GitHub, 2) delete it if it's not needed, 3) add it to `.gitignore` if it's a file I want to keep locally but not send to GitHub. (Keep in mind that files in .gitignore are not backed up unless you have another backup system.) If I have a file that belongs somewhere else, I will move it there, so the only files left are the ones to send to GitHub.

The next step is to click the **Commit** button and enter a commit message that meaningful describes what was done. Finally clicking the **Up Arrow** will send the commit to GitHub. 

It's not considered good practice to commit too often, but as a beginner, it's useful to do so to learn how it all works.

## Branching: your repo

Once you've comfortable with the workflow described above, you're ready to start branching. The process is quite similar whether you're working on your own repo or someone else's. 

If it's *your* repo, you can follow the steps in [these slides](https://github.com/jtr13/EDAV/blob/master/pdfs/BranchingYourRepo.pdf){target="_blank"}, which provide step-by-step detail on creating a branch, doing work on the branch and then submitting a pull request to merge the changes into origin/master. Or you can follow the steps below, skipping steps 1 and 3.

## Branching: someone else's repo

### Step 1: Fork the upstream repo (once) {-}

*Skip this step if you are syncing with your own repo.*

Let's say you want to contribute to EDAV! Fork [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/jtr13/EDAV){target="_blank"} and then on your own GitHub page, you will see a forked **EDAV** repo under the repositories section. Note, from now on, the term **upstream repository** refers to the original repo of the project that you forked and the term **origin repository** refers to the repo that you created or forked on GitHub. From your respective, both **upstream** and **origin** are remote repositories.

### Step 2: Clone origin and create a local repository (once) {-}

A **local repository** is the repo that resides on your computer. In order to be able to work locally, we need to create a local copy of the remote reposiotry.

Since we have already connected Git with RStudio, we can create a local repo in the following way. In RStudio, click **File** -> **New Project** -> **Version Control** -> **Git**. Now you can fill in the url of the **origin** repo and click **Create Project** to create a local repository.

Once created, make sure you can see a **Terminal** section in RStudio because this is where we type in all the Git command lines.

### Step 3: Configure remote that points to the upstream repository (once) {-}

*Skip this step if you're syncing with your own repo.*

The purpose of this step is to specify the location of the upstream repository. It may not make sense to you at this moment, but soon it will become clear.

To complete this step, type in the following command line: 

`> git remote add upstream <upstream repo url>`

Source: [Configuring a remote for a fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork){target="_blank"}


### Step 4: Pull {-}

Under the Git tab in RStudio, you can see a pull button, which is represented by a downward pointing arrow. Clicking that button is equivalent to running a git pull command. The purpose of a pull command is to fetch and download content from a remote repository, and in this case we want to pull from the `origin/master` and make sure `local/master` is updated to match the content. 

Now we can create a new branch and work on new features that we want to add into the **EDAV** project. Notice that steps 1, 2 and 3 only need to be done once when you start working on a new project. However, whenever you want to create a new branch, **pull command** is **always** the first step as you want to keep your local repository up to date. 

Now you might have a question: what is a branch? Branching is the way to work on different parts of a repository at one time. It creates a snapshot of the original branch. Eventually, after you have finalized your work, you will merge your work into the upstream repository. 

To create a branch, 

![](images/Git_step4.PNG)

Click the purple button under the Git tab, create a meaningful name for your branch. For example, if you hope to add more content into the histogram chapter in EDAV, name your branch "HistogramChapter". In this way, both a local branch and a remote branch under the origin repo will be created.

### Step 5: Work, commit and push {-}

Be careful and make sure you are doing work under the local branch instead of the local master. Once you make some changes in your local repository (e.g. edit, add or delete a file), you will see the list of files that you have modified under the Git tab. 

![](images/Git_step5_commit.PNG)

This means, the changes you have made are in your working directory but not committed to local repository yet. You might feel confused about these terms, so let's look at a graphical illustration.

![](images/Git_step5.png)

We have already explained the relationship between local repo and remote repo. In addition, there are two extra layers between the working directory (the place where you store all these files on your computer) and the local repo. To keep your local repo updated with the working directory, you need to first **add** the changes to a **staging area** and then **commit** these changes to the local repo. Finally, you want to push your local branch to the remote repo.

When you use Git with RStudio, you do not need to write Git commands to add, commit or push. To **add**, you simply check the checkbox for each file you have modified. To **commit**, you just click on the **commit** button under the Git tab. In fact, you can commit as many times as needed. Finally, you can click on the **push** button, which is represented by an upward pointing arrow.

### Step 6: Submit a pull request {-}

Now you are able to see the branch you have created on the GitHub page. The next step is to submit a pull request and the process is very similar to the process described in the [GitHub only walkthrough](contribute.html#github-only-walkthrough).

### Step 7: Delete the branch {-}

Once the merge is accepted, it's good practice to delete this branch since the upstream already contains all the changes you have made. To delete the branch on origin, you can simply use GitHub. To delete the branch locally, type the following in the terminal:

`> git branch -d branchname`

We also need to stop tracking the remote branch using the following Git command: 

`> git fetch -p`. 

### Step 8: Sync your fork

This should be done at the beginning of your next work session to make sure that the code you work on matches the version on GitHub.

If it's your repo, you can bring down the changes that were merged into origin/master with:

`> git pull`

Note that the flow of new code is:

**local branch --> origin/branch --> origin/master --> local master**

It's important to remember to do this, because the next branch you create will be a copy of local master, and it needs to be up to date.

If you're working on someone else's repo, make sure you've completed Step 3 above. Then, right before you start working again on the project, do the following to sync your fork:

`> git fetch upstream`

`> git checkout master`

`> git merge upstream/master`

## Merging a pull request

There are many methods to merge a request. The most direct simple and direct is to [merge the PR on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/merging-a-pull-request#merging-a-pull-request-on-github). This method works well for merging fixed typos and the like. If you want to be able to test code, you may want to check out the PR locally, test it, and perhaps even make edits to it before merging. 

Best practices in this area are evolving. My current recommendation is to use the `usethis` package, which makes complex tasks very simple. ["How to edit a pull request locally"](https://github.com/jtr13/usethis_demos/blob/master/how_to1.md) explains how to do so.

Another great resource is ["Explore and extend a pull request"](https://happygitwithr.com/pr-extend.html) in *Happy Git with R*. This chapter describes two official GitHub versions of merging a pull request, as well as a workflow in development using `git2r`. 

## Random git stuff that may be useful

### Undo the last commit

`git reset --soft HEAD~1`

### Undo changes since the last commit

`git reset HEAD --hard`

### Forgot to branch (didn't commit)

Just create the new branch and changes will be moved there... [changes in the working directory do not belong to a branch until they are committed](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1394804/5314416){target="_blank"} (It will appear that the changes are on master too, but once you commit the changes, they will be gone from master.)
